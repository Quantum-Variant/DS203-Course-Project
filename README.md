# DS203 Course Project - Solar Activity Analysis

In this project, we study the dependency and relationships of solar flares on sunspots and any surface activity on the sun. This led us to analyse correlations between solar activity and solar flares over time.

We utilised measurements like duration of the flare, energy and time of occurrence to derive conclusions. 

Our data primarily comes from two sources - one of NASA's RHESSI Mission datasets and the Konus-Wind Solar Flare Database by Laboratory for Experimental Astrophysics, Ioffe Institute. 

We have analysed the correlations between different factors, and the distribution of energy of solar flares to determine the frequency count of flares of different energy ranges over a period of time.

We then trained a Long Short-Term Memory Model and an Autoregression model on both the datasets and compared their relative predictive precision.
